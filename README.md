## Contributions :

GabtTag is written to be as easily maintainable and extensible as possible.

If you want to contribute, there is several thing you can do :

- Add a new Python file to handle a new extension (like .mp3) and add the new classe in the moteur.py file; you can take as an example the MP3Handler.
- Design a improved icon 
- Improve the layout of the app (window.ui file)
- Add unitary tests (in tests/)
- Multi-folder tree in the left panel 
- Work on more advanced features like Automatic tagging (using web)
