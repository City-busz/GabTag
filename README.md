## Development Instruction:

GabtTags is written to be as easily maintainable and extensible as possible.

### Contributions :

If you want to contribute, you can add a extension Handler :

- you can just add a new Python file to handle a new extension (like .mp3); you can take as an example the MP3Handler.
- Then add your handler in the moteur.py file
